# Project03-Analyze-A-B-test-results-NN
Use results of the A/B test to help company decide which website page should implement.


This project was submitted as part of the data analyst nanodegree certification process.

In this project, I use A/B testing to compare two versions of a web page of an e-commerce website to figure out which variation performs better.

The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert,"
meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. 
My goal was to work through the process to help the company understand if they should implement
the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
